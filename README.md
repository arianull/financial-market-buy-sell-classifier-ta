# Machine Learning Project for Classifying Technical Analysis Data to Buy/Sell Positions


This is a machine learning project for classifying technical analysis data to buy/sell positions target. The project utilizes yfinance as the data source and exports the best model to C language to do a backtest on MQL and MetaTrader.

## Background
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to predict whether to buy or sell a particular stock based on technical analysis data. The project uses yfinance to obtain historical data for a particular stock and then applies various machine learning algorithms to determine the best approach for predicting whether to buy or sell the stock.

The best model is then exported to C language to be used in backtesting on MQL and MetaTrader platforms.
